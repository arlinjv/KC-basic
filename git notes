How do I want to do versioning for the Kelly controller projects?
- Adding MCU is major inflection point and will be basis for future versions
	- btw concept of first MCU board is to have one controller board for two KCs (either one side or traditional two wheel drive)
- First 'manual' / non-MCU version has lots of super useful screenshots and notes. 
	- Save this version in another branch as 'base' (?) 

Commands
- git log 
	- git log -p to see diffs only. 
	- type q or z to get out
	- useful for getting sha when want to checkout previous commit
